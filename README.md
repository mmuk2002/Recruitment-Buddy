# Recruitment-Buddy

## BACKGROUND
Our client is Product Space, an organization that aims to help students land Product Management and Software Engineering positions. 
We plan to build an internship and new grad recruitment tool that pre-professional clubs can use to match with experienced students and schedule mock interviews. 
This web app addresses the issues of connecting with current Vanderbilt students, who have industry experience. 
In the recruitment process, practice and one-on-one mentorship are key to preparing for job interviews. 
Currently, most students search on LinkedIn for alumni with relevant experience, reach out, and then wait days to weeks for a response. 
If they are lucky enough to get in contact with an employee at their desired company, they have to find a place and time for a mock interview. 
Also, during the interview, the interviewer has to dedicate time and energy to figuring out which questions they should ask for the position the student is interviewing for. 
Our project aims to streamline the mock interview process so that students can focus more time on preparation rather than logistics.

## GET STARTED
Clone the repository, and then npm install inside both client and server folders, and then npm start inside each of them.

## SCOPE
The scope of this project is to create a web-based application to assist Vanderbilt students in their respective recruitment processes. 
This application is exclusive to Vanderbilt undergraduate students and serves as a platform to enable students to help their peers secure jobs in their intended industries. 
The application allows students to create profiles with details about their experience, skills, and interests. 
Then, a matching algorithm works to find a mentor for the student that is best suited to help them by analyzing the prospective mentorâ€™s experience and skill level. 
Finally, the application will enable both the mentee and the mentor to indicate their availability via Google Calendar to schedule an appropriate time to meet and conduct a mock interview. 
From this, the mentee can receive in-person feedback from an experienced mentor and hone in on their technical and speaking skills to prepare for upcoming interviews.

## FRAMEWORK
We will be using the FERN Stack for this project.
Firebase will be easier for backend and Google authentication process because this platform is meant for Vanderbilt students.
React will be used for frontend.
Node.js/Express will be efficient non-blocking I/O model is particularly suited for our data-intensive, real-time application needs. The Express framework complements Node.js by providing a comprehensive feature set for both web and mobile applications, thereby streamlining our server-side development.

# Recruitment-Buddy

# BACKGROUND
# Our client is Product Space, an organization that aims to help students land Product Management and Software Engineering positions. 
# We plan to build an internship and new grad recruitment tool that pre-professional clubs can use to match with experienced students and schedule mock interviews. 
# This web app addresses the issues of connecting with current Vanderbilt students, who have industry experience. 
# In the recruitment process, practice and one-on-one mentorship are key to preparing for job interviews. 
# Currently, most students search on LinkedIn for alumni with relevant experience, reach out, and then wait days to weeks for a response. 
# If they are lucky enough to get in contact with an employee at their desired company, they have to find a place and time for a mock interview. 
# Also, during the interview, the interviewer has to dedicate time and energy to figuring out which questions they should ask for the position the student is interviewing for. 
# Our project aims to streamline the mock interview process so that students can focus more time on preparation rather than logistics.

# SCOPE
# The scope of this project is to create a web-based application to assist Vanderbilt students in their respective recruitment processes. 
# This application is exclusive to Vanderbilt undergraduate students and serves as a platform to enable students to help their peers secure jobs in their intended industries. 
# The application allows students to create profiles with details about their experience, skills, and interests by pulling information from the students’ LinkedIn accounts. 
# Then, a matching algorithm works to find a mentor for the student that is best suited to help them by analyzing the prospective mentor’s experience and skill level. 
# Finally, the application will enable both the mentee and the mentor to indicate their availability via Google Calendar to schedule an appropriate time to meet and conduct a mock interview. 
# From this, the mentee can receive in-person feedback from an experienced mentor and hone in on their technical and speaking skills to prepare for upcoming interviews.
